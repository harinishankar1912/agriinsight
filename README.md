AgriInsight is a prototype built for Project Samarth, an initiative to create an intelligent Q&A system that answers complex questions about Indiaâ€™s agricultural economy and climate data.

The system allows users to ask natural language questions (like rainfall or crop trends), processes government datasets from data.gov.in, and provides accurate, data-backed insights with source citations.
